## Inventory Check with CAS Casting

Start with CAS Casting and make your storage more efficient with a thorough check of model plates and core boxes. Take a look at the condition of your storage and find out which model plates are really needed. Models that are rarely to never used are ideal for digitization. This way, we save storage space by storing this information digitally. With this approach, you use your storage space optimally: Physical space remains for frequently used models, while everything else is digitally available.

Our services include conducting pilot projects to promote digitization and additive manufacturing, technical assessments, and economic analyses of spare parts. Discover the advantages:

* **Efficiency Increase**: Optimize your storage and reduce costs.
* **Cost Reduction**: Get precise control over inventory and resources.
* **Faster Time to Market**: Benefit from demand-oriented production.
* **Informed Decisions**: Use a solid data foundation for your strategy.
